#### 100 Days of Coding ‚Äì Data Science Journey

This is a learning challenge based on the #100DaysOfCode format. For 100 consecutive days, I will dedicate at least one hour each day to learning and practicing **data science**. My aim is to build a solid foundation and complete small projects along the way.

This journey is tracked day by day in this repository, with clear topics, goals, and milestones.

#### Roadmap Overview

The challenge is organized into weekly themes to build up knowledge step-by-step:

- **Weeks 1‚Äì2:** Python Programming (Basics to Intermediate)
- **Weeks 3‚Äì4:** NumPy & Pandas for Data Analysis
- **Week 5:** SQL for Data Science
- **Week 6:** Statistics and Probability
- **Week 7:** Linear Algebra with NumPy
- **Week 8:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Week 9:** Introduction to Machine Learning
- **Week 10:** Unsupervised Learning
- **Weeks 11‚Äì12:** Capstone Projects

---

#### Daily Format

Each day includes:
- A **learning goal** (e.g. ‚ÄúIntro to Pandas‚Äù or ‚ÄúSQL Joins‚Äù)
- A **coding task or mini project**
- A **checkbox** to track progress

You can view the full roadmap in the 100 Days of Data Science Coding Roadmap.pdf file.
